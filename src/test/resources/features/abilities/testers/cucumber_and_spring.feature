Ability: Execute specifications via a Cucumber and Spring combination
  In order to better understand Cucumber and Spring combination
  As a software tester
  I want to execute a simple specification using Cucumber combined with Spring and Testcontainers

  Example: Using Spring and Testcontainers

    Scot is one of our software testing experts.

    Given Scot has a multi-component test scenario
    When Scot executes the scenario via Cucumber, Spring and Testcontainers
    Then a Cucumber report is generated
