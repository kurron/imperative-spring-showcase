Ability: Execute specifications via pure Cucumber
  In order to better understand Cucumber without add-ons
  As a software tester
  I want to execute a simple specification using Cucumber only

  Example: Using stubbed test doubles only

    Scot is one of our software testing experts.

    Given Scot has a test scenario
    When Scot executes the scenario via Cucumber only
    Then a Cucumber report is generated
